h1. Pax Web Resource Mapping sample

As a test case for issue http://team.ops4j.org/browse/PAXWEB-435

h2. Building & Running

1. Install Pax Web Whiteboard Extender in Karaf:

   @features:install -v war@

2. Build the project using @mvn install@ or by importing to Eclipse
3. Deploy the bundles @com.hendyirawan.paxwebresmap.first@ and @com.hendyirawan.paxwebresmap.second@
   to Karaf
4. Test by visiting: http://localhost:8181/images/logo.jpg
   This will show Soluvas logo, as Bippo logo contained by second bundle is skipped.

Then:

5. Edit the @first.xml@ Blueprint to change the @alias@ to, say, @/images2@
6. Redeploy the @com.hendyirawan.paxwebresmap.first@ bundle
7. Notice that the Soluvas logo is accessible from http://localhost:8181/images2/logo.jpg .
   However the Bippo logo is not accessible from http://localhost:8181/images/logo.jpg (404 Not Found).
   In fact http://localhost:8181/images/ is not mapped at all.
